# Python Dependency Management Tools Comparison

This repository provides a comparison of three popular Python dependency management tools: 
- `pip` and `venv`
- `poetry` and
- `uv`. 

Each subdirectory contains an implementation of a super simple data science workflow (`data_pipeline.py`) using one of these tools.
