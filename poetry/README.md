# Managing Python Dependencies with Poetry

This demonstrates a simple data science workflow using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, managed with Poetry for streamlined dependency and environment management.

## Why Use Poetry?

Poetry simplifies Python project management by combining dependency management and virtual environment handling into a single tool. It offers:

- Easy creation and management of project environments.
- Automatic resolution of dependency conflicts.
- Lockfile generation for reproducible environments.
- Enhanced dependency declaration using `pyproject.toml`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Poetry is installed on your system. Follow the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if needed.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Initialize a Poetry Project:**

```bash
poetry init
```

    Answer the prompts to create a `pyproject.toml` file. Alternatively, use the `--no-interaction` flag for defaults.

2. **Add Dependencies:**

```bash
poetry add pandas scikit-learn
```

Poetry automatically resolves and locks dependencies in the `poetry.lock` file for consistent environments.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

```bash
poetry shell
```

4. **Run the Script:**

```bash
python data_pipeline.py
```

Or, if you prefer to run  without entering the poetry shell:

```bash
poetry run python data_pipeline.py
```

## Reproducing the Environment

To replicate the environment on a new machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url> && cd <repository-directory>
```

2. **Install dependencies from the lockfile:**

```bash
poetry install
```

This ensures the exact versions of dependencies are used.

## Key Improvements Over pip/venv

- Unified Tooling: Poetry handles both dependency management and virtual environments, reducing the need for multiple tools like pip and venv.

- Reproducibility: The `poetry.lock` file ensures all collaborators use identical dependency versions, avoiding "it works on my machine" issues.

- Dependency Resolution: Poetry automatically resolves complex dependency trees and prevents version conflicts.

- Modern Syntax: The `pyproject.toml` file simplifies dependency declaration and aligns with modern Python packaging standards.

- Simplified Workflow: Common commands like `poetry add` and `poetry install` replace the need for manual `pip install` and `pip freeze` workflows.

## Deactivating the Environment

Exit the Poetry-managed shell with:
```bash
exit
```

Notes for Data Science Projects
Poetryâ€™s enhanced reproducibility is particularly useful in data science projects where library versions can significantly impact model behavior.
The poetry.lock file ensures environments are consistent across development, testing, and production.
